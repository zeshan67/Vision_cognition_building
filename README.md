# Vision_cognition_building
This Python-based app uses a camera to detect room boundaries and track real-time human movement. Leveraging OpenCV for video processing and MediaPipe for pose estimation, it generates a 2D floor plan and maps movement paths. Users can visualize movements live, export data for analysis, and control the app via a simple GUI.
